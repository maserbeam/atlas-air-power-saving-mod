This is downloadable HTML and sound file that will continuously play the included audio to prevent Atlas Air headsets from going into it's 7-second threshold power saving mode. It was vibe coded with Grok.
I made this because I was annoyed with Turtle Beach's Atlas Air constantly going into power saving mode, which causes it to cut-off the first second of any audio that is preceded by 7 or so seconds of apparent silence.

If you want to make your own audio file, it can be done with Audacity (https://www.audacityteam.org/).

Open Audacity, go to Generate > Noise<br/>

Then select a noise type. I went with white, with an amplitude of 0.001 as shown for 30 seconds. I haven't tested with quieter amplitudes.<br/>

It should create a track of white noise that is just under -60dB, which I personally would never notice unless I intentionally try to increase volume enough to blast my ears off. Your mileage (and ears) may vary.<br/>

Personally, I haven't noticed a drastic drop in battery duration unless I leave the headset unattended but powered on, like overnight.
